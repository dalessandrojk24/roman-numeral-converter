Roman Numeral Converter

📜 About the Project

This Roman Numeral Converter was created as part of the requirements to complete freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification. The project takes a number (between 0 and 4000) as input and converts it into its equivalent Roman numeral representation.

🚀 Features

- Converts numbers between **0 and 4000** to Roman numerals.
- User-friendly interface styled like an **ancient scroll**.
- Input validation to ensure correct number entry.
- Interactive button for conversion.

🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling (scroll-inspired design)
- JavaScript for logic and conversion algorithm

🔮 Future Plans

- Expand the number range beyond 4000, incorporating an overline notation for larger values.
- Add reverse conversion (convert Roman numerals back to numbers).
- Enhance UI/UX with animations and additional historical-themed elements.
- Optimize performance with more efficient numeral conversion logic.

🏗️ How to Use

1. Open the link 
2. Enter a number (between 0 and 4000) in the input field.
3. Click the "Convert" button.
4. View the result displayed in Roman numerals.

💡 Inspiration

This project was inspired by the challenge of working with historical numeral systems while improving JavaScript algorithm skills.
